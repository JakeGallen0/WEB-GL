        <h3>Definite article</h3>

        <p>
          A definite article is an article that marks a definite noun phrase.
          Definite articles, such as the English the, are used to refer to a
          particular member of a group. It may be something that the speaker has
          already mentioned, or it may be otherwise something uniquely
          specified.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, Sentence 1 uses the definite article and thus, expresses
          a request for a particular book. In contrast, Sentence 2 uses an
          indefinite article and thus, conveys that the speaker would be
          satisfied with any book.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="thick-list">Give me the book.</li>
          <li class="thick-list">Give me a book.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The definite article can also be used in English to indicate a
          specific class among other classes:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >The cabbage white butterfly lays its eggs on members of the
            Brassica genus.</em
          >
        </p>

        However, recent developments show that definite articles are
        morphological elements linked to certain noun types due to
        lexicalization. Under this point of view, definiteness does not play a
        role in the selection of a definite article more than the lexical entry
        attached to the article.[clarification needed]
        <p>
          Some languages (such as the continental North Germanic languages,
          Bulgarian or Romanian) have definite articles only as suffixes.

        <p>
          An indefinite article is an article that marks an indefinite noun
          phrase. Indefinite articles are those such as English "some" or "a",
          which do not refer to a specific identifiable entity. Indefinites are
          commonly used to introduce a new discourse referent which can be
          referred back to in subsequent discussion:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>A monster ate a cookie.His name is Cookie Monster.</li>
        </ol>
        Indefinites can also be used to generalize over entities who have some
        property in common:
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>A cookie is a wonderful thing to eat.</li>
        </ol>
        Indefinites can also be used to refer to specific entities whose precise
        identity is unknown or unimportant.
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>
            A monster must have broken into my house last night and eaten all my
            cookies..
          </li>
          <li>
            A friend of mine told me that happens frequently to people who live
            on Sesame Street.
          </li>
        </ol>

        Indefinites also have predicative uses:
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>Leaving my door unlocked was a bad decision.</li>
        </ol>
        Indefinite noun phrases are widely studied within linguistics, in
        particular because of their ability to take exceptional scope.
        <br />
        <h3>Proper article</h3>
        <img

        />
        <p>
          A proper article indicates that its noun is proper, and refers to a
          unique entity. It may be the name of a person, the name of a place,
          the name of a planet, etc. The Māori language has the proper article
          a, which is used for personal nouns; so, "a Pita" means "Peter". In
          Māori, when the personal nouns have the definite or indefinite article
          as an important part of it, both articles are present; for example,
          the phrase "a Te Rauparaha", which contains both the proper article a
          and the definite article Te refers to the person name Te Rauparaha.
        </p>
        <p>
          The definite article is sometimes also used with proper names, which
          are already specified by definition (there is just one of them). For
          example: the Amazon, the Hebrides. In these cases, the definite
          article may be considered superfluous. Its presence can be accounted
          for by the assumption that they are shorthand for a longer phrase in
          which the name is a specifier, i.e. the Amazon River, the Hebridean
          Islands.[citation needed] Where the nouns in such longer phrases
          cannot be omitted, the definite article is universally kept: the
          United States, the People's Republic of China.
        </p>
        This distinction can sometimes become a political matter: the former
        usage the Ukraine stressed the word's Russian meaning of "borderlands";
        as Ukraine became a fully independent state following the collapse of
        the Soviet Union, it requested that formal mentions of its name omit the
        article. Similar shifts in usage have occurred in the names of Sudan and
        both Congo (Brazzaville) and Congo (Kinshasa); a move in the other
        direction occurred with The Gambia. In certain languages, such as French
        and Italian, definite articles are used with all or most names of
        countries: la France, le Canada, l'Allemagne; l'Italia, la Spagna, il
        Brasile.
        <dl>
          <dd>
            If a name [has] a definite article, e.g. <em>the Kremlin</em>, it
            cannot idiomatically be used without it: we cannot say
            <em>Boris Yeltsin</em> is in Kremlin.
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>— R. W. Burchfield</p>
        Some languages use definite articles with personal names, as in
        Portuguese (a Maria, literally: "the Maria"), Greek (η Μαρία, ο Γιώργος,
        ο Δούναβης, η Παρασκευή), and Catalan (la Núria, el/en Oriol). Such
        usage also occurs colloquially or dialectally in Spanish, German,
        French, Italian and other languages. In Hungarian, the colloquial use of
        definite articles with personal names, though widespread, is considered
        to be a Germanism.
        <br />
        The definite article sometimes appears in American English nicknames
        such as "the Donald", referring to former president Donald Trump, and
        "the Gipper", referring to former president Ronald Reagan.[4]
        <br />
        <h3>Partitive article</h3>
        A partitive article is a type of article, sometimes viewed as a type of
        indefinite article, used with a mass noun such as water, to indicate a
        non-specific quantity of it. Partitive articles are a class of
        determiner; they are used in French and Italian in addition to definite
        and indefinite articles. (In Finnish and Estonian, the partitive is
        indicated by inflection.) The nearest equivalent in English is some,
        although it is classified as a determiner, and English uses it less than
        French uses de.
        <br />
        French: Veux-tu du café ? Do you want (some) coffee? For more
        information, see the article on the French partitive article. Haida has
        a partitive article (suffixed -gyaa) referring to "part of something
        or... to one or more objects of a given group or category," e.g.,
        tluugyaa uu hal tlaahlaang "he is making a boat (a member of the
        category of boats)."[5]
        <br />
        <h3>Negative article</h3>
        A negative article specifies none of its noun, and can thus be regarded
        as neither definite nor indefinite. On the other hand, some consider
        such a word to be a simple determiner rather than an article. In
        English, this function is fulfilled by no, which can appear before a
        singular or plural noun:
        <br />
        No man has been on this island. No dogs are allowed here. No one is in
        the room. In German, the negative article is, among other variations,
        kein, in opposition to the indefinite article ein.
        <br />
        Ein Hund – a dog Kein Hund – no dog The equivalent in Dutch is geen:
        <br />
        een hond – a dog geen hond – no dog
        <h3>Zero article</h3>
        See also: Zero article in English The zero article is the absence of an
        article. In languages having a definite article, the lack of an article
        specifically indicates that the noun is indefinite. Linguists interested
        in X-bar theory causally link zero articles to nouns lacking a
        determiner.[6] In English, the zero article rather than the indefinite
        is used with plurals and mass nouns, although the word "some" can be
        used as an indefinite plural article.
